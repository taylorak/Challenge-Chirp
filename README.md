# Getting Started
- Create your own git repository for this exercise.
- Commit often with meaningful commit messages.

# Goal
Chirp Chirp Chirp Chirp

## Specs
Create a function that accepts a single argument which will be a Number. 
This function will return a string with the word "Chirp" based on the number passed in when invoked.

Build this function using Recursion

![To Understand Recursion, One Must First Understand Recursion](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2446/3620061163_ba9f8d5031_z.jpg)

**Example**

     chirp(3);  //-> returns "chirp chirp chirp"
     
## Write Tests First!
Using Mocha and Chai, write tests for your chirp function before building the `chirp` function. 

> Test-Driven Development, Ho!

## Bonus
Modify your function so that it accepts a second argument which will be a String. This string will replace the default word: "Chirp".
